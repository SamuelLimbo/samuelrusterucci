            <p class="PM_M31M33"> We revise the study from Salomon et al. (2021) by determining the proper motions of the same star samples and unveiling hidden systematics clarifying the inconsistencies of those results and the ones from previous works. We implemented a fully Bayesian inference method which after adding more quasars to the already underdense Gaia reference frame around M31, and re-doing the same for M33, enabled us to derive correction maps locally accounting for the motion of the background quasars for both galaxies. Subsequently, we inferred the motion of sub-samples of the blue and red stars which revealed inconsistencies which we think emerge from underlying hidden systematics.</p>
